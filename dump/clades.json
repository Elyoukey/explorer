There are more distinguishing features than just their size. For one thing, although all of them, including humans, have the same number of hair follicles all over their bodies, they are described as having more sparse hair than \"lesser apes\" or non-hominid monkeys. But they also have an unprecedented brain-size-to-body mass of any animal on Earth. Consequently, they also have the most complex socio-emotional relationships of any other \"social animal. &nbsp;All apes also share a unique dentition of 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 premolars, and 3 molars in each quarter of the mouth. In most cases, the canine is reduced, almost useless as a cynodont tooth. And the molars are also unique in all the animal kingdom. Every ape has them, and only apes have them. Each molar comes to five points interrupted by a Y-shaped crevasse. If you want to know what that looks like, go to a mirror and open your mouth real wide. &nbsp;When you do that, also look at the dome-shape in the roof of your mouth. Therein lies the only significant difference between humans and the other apes that are still alive. That shape, that bit of space above the tongue that the other apes don't have, is what allows us to form words. None of the other great apes can speak because of that little extra space in the mouth which only we possess. But other apes are all capable of complex communication either by their own body language in addition to grunts and squeals with particular meanings, or by learned forms of sign language or symbols taught to them. Koko the gorilla is the most famous of the articulate signing non-human apes. Washoe the chimpanzee and Chantek the orangutan are other famous examples, and of course there are many more around the world who are not so well-known. These beings definitely aren't just mimicking their owners, nor are they \"trained\" to appear as if they really know what they're saying. This is no stupid pet trick. All of them have been repeatedly proven to possess sufficient cognitive skills and comprehension of the meanings of their words, and they may know more than a thousand of them. And they all use these words to express personal feelings, love and compassion, and all of them grieve for their loved ones who have died. One of them, Michael, Koko's life mate, even remembered his mother being killed on the day he was captured. Upon his death, one of Koko's human visitors told her that Mike was now an angel, to which the grieving gorilla responded \"Imagine\". &nbsp;They're not as intelligent as we are because our frontal lobes are larger than any of theirs. But they are definitely intelligent, even sentient beings. Even among the smartest creatures on earth, we are still the smartest by far. But we are not so unique, nor so far above them that we are not still one of them.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>v=DZv8VyIQ7YU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR0R4S8T5iFXc2XDEwClgFMgFE8SzhiemhuL1b190dwom4aOmVMHo1Wy8w4</p>","name":"Hominidae","parent":{"$oid":"579b6866343108b67edc5431"},"created":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1483722439555"}},"assets":[{"name":"8c85629224b27264d778bb8c37c1a6f6.jpeg","isDefault":false,"folder":"clades"}],"__v":{"$numberInt":"3"},"attributions":[]}{"_id":{"$oid":"579b6866343108b67edc5431"},"modified":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1488687603022"}},"extant":true,"otherNames":null,"description":"Hominoids (apes) emerged from within Propliopithecoidea, and are another subset of Old World monkeys, all with uniquely distinctive fingerprints.

One of these are the splayed position of the nostrils. Old World monkeys have downward turned nostrils, and most of them have a recognizable nose. None of this group has claws. All of their nails are as flat and harmless as our own. For grasping, they've replaced their claws with sensative fingertips, and each of them bears a uniquely distinctive fingerprint as well, particularly in certain subgroups. In Platyrrhines, the tail is usually long and prehensile. But among Catarrhines, the tail is effectively useless and unimportant since most of these monkeys now live on the ground. Some Catarrhines have weak, wispy tails, some have short stubs for a tail, and many don't have any tail at all. \n\nModern catarrhine species which are traditionally recognized as \"monkeys\" are all Cercopithecids.

They have only two actual breasts, pectoral mammae which are unlike those of any other mammal. And unlike lemurs, most monkeys have completely lost the ability to move their ears. Only a few individuals remain who can even wiggle them anymore. Monkeys also lack the specialized sensory whiskers and the wet nose that lemurs and so many \"lesser\" animals have. Among the other obvious external differences are that male monkeys' genetalia are naked and pendulous in that they're not thethered to their abdomens anymore, as they are on most other eutherians. They have a tendency toward bipedalism.  Like most bats, but unlike lemurs, monkeys usually have a flatter face, and all monkeys have completely forward-facing binocular eyes and trichromatic vision, meaning that monkeys can see in color where lemurs, and most other mammals can't. Monkeys have other internal distinctions from prosimians too. They all have a well-developed caecum, which is a sort of distension in the digestive tract that is mildly advantageous. But they have detrimental mutations too. All anthropoids have lost the ability to synthesize either vitamin D3 or vitamin C, and need to supplement both of these in their diet or they'll succumb to a condition of malnutrition commonly known as scurvy. \n\nBahinia, Eosimias, and Amphipithecus are each protoanthropoids from the Eocene. Apidium is popularly considered to be both a parapithecid “monkey” and a potential ancestor of all other monkeys as well as apes and humans. As an online tutorial about early primate evolution maintained by Dennis O’Neil of Palomar College states, \"Monkeys evolved during the early Oligocene or possibly near the end of the Eocene. Their ancestors were most likely prosimians. These monkeys were the first species of our infraorder—the Anthropoidea\".\n\nIn a monophyletic classification system, everything in this clade is a monkey or a descendant of a monkey. And since there is no way to determine when the descendants of monkeys aren't monkeys anymore, then all their descendants should still be monkeys. Because again, monkeys can be defined by all of these characters, or they can be defined by a collective tally of them as \"members of the clade, \"Anthropoidea\" (or Simiiformes). Either way, humans may be really big smart monkeys.  But we are still monkeys in the same way that lions are cats, the way that ducks are birds.

Well formed nut.</p>\n<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>\n<p>About a billion years after the formation of our planet, living organisms appear on earth about 3.5 BYA and fill the earth within another 500 MY. Eukaryotes evolve after a further 500 MY. All living organisms except bacteria and archaea are currently listed as Eukarya. This includes animals, plants, fungi and protists. Protists are often referred to as the junk box for organisms not easily located within other kingdoms and may include multiple kingdoms in themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Defining features, key features and its evolutionary origin</strong></h3>\n<p>Any organism whose cells contain a nucleus and other organelles enclosed within a membrane. Eukaryotic innovations include the cell cycle complete with a chromosome segregation apparatus, sexual reproduction complete with recombination, a cytoskeleton, spliceosomes and introns, small regulatory RNAs, vesicular transport based on membrane proteins, serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase signaling networks, the use of ubiquitin in post-translational protein modification, and a variety of new genes. See the images below and if you click on any (or the sunnyorange.eu link), and it will lead you to a page which explains multiple possible origins for Eukaryotes. Whilst many believe that Eukaryotes evolved from the super-domain, Prokaryotes, some consider that Eukaryotes may have evolved into Prokaryotes or that all three domains arose simultaneously. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Clade divisions</strong></h3>\n<p>Bacteria and Archaea are the other two domains/clade branches. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Who named it and when?\t</strong></h3>\n<p>Chatton (1925); Whitaker and Margulis (1978) Chatton, E. 1925.
